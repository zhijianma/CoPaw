"""ScrollContextManager — write-through + eviction-index context management.

The strategy form of the design in ``CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.html``: instead of
subclassing the agent, it is injected into :class:`QwenPawAgent` and drives the
two delegated hooks.

* :meth:`on_save` — every live turn is persisted to the durable
  ``conversation_history`` as it enters the window (write-through).
* :meth:`compress` — past the token threshold, keep the recent tail (and the
  active turn), update a continuation summary, and fold the
  evicted middle into an in-context :class:`EvictionIndex`. The summary is a
  state cache, never a replacement for raw history. Code records its durable
  provenance range; exact navigation and recovery stay in the eviction index.

## Tool Setup

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

### What Goes Here

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.

Things like:

- SSH hosts and aliases
- Other user-related settings when executing skills

### Examples

```markdown
### SSH

- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin
```

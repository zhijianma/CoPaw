# Security Policy

If you believe you've found a security issue in CoPaw, please report it privately.

## Reporting

Report vulnerabilities of the CoPaw repository:

If you discover a security issue in CoPaw, please report it to us through the [Alibaba Security Response Center (ASRC)](https://security.alibaba.com/).

### Required in Reports

1. **Title**
2. **Severity assessment**
3. **Impact**
4. **Affected component** (e.g. channel adapter, skill, config loading)
5. **Technical reproduction steps**
6. **Demonstrated impact** (how it crosses a trust boundary, not just theoretical)
7. **Environment** (Python version, OS, how CoPaw is run)
8. **Remediation advice** (if you have suggestions)

Reports without reproduction steps, demonstrated impact, and remediation advice will be deprioritized. Given the volume of scanner or AI-generated findings, we need vetted reports from researchers who understand the issues.

### Report Acceptance Gate

For fastest triage, include all of the following:

- Exact vulnerable path (file, function, and line range) on a current revision.
- Tested version details (CoPaw version and/or commit SHA).
- Reproducible PoC against latest `main` or latest released version.
- Demonstrated impact tied to CoPaw's documented trust boundaries (see below).
- For exposed-secret reports: proof the credential is CoPaw-owned or grants access to CoPaw-operated infrastructure/services.
- Scope check explaining why the report is **not** covered by the Out of Scope section below.

Reports that miss these requirements may be closed as `invalid` or `no-action`.

### Common False-Positive Patterns

- Prompt-injection-only chains without a boundary bypass (prompt injection is out of scope).
- Operator-intended local features (e.g. skills or commands the operator explicitly enabled) presented as remote injection.
- Authorized user–triggered actions presented as privilege escalation (e.g. an allowed sender triggering a skill that writes to an allowed path). In this trust model, authorized user actions are trusted unless you demonstrate an auth/sandbox/boundary bypass.
- Reports that only show a malicious skill executing privileged actions after a trusted operator installs/enables it.
- Reports that assume per-user multi-tenant authorization on a shared CoPaw instance/config.
- ReDoS/DoS claims that require trusted operator configuration input without a trust-boundary bypass.
- Scanner-only claims against stale or nonexistent paths, or claims without a working repro.

### Duplicate Report Handling

- Search existing advisories and issues before filing.
- Include likely duplicate advisory IDs in your report when applicable.
- Maintainers may close lower-quality or later duplicates in favor of the earliest high-quality canonical report.

## Alignment with `copaw init`

The security model and recommended baseline in this document are **aligned with** what users see and accept during **`copaw init`**. The init flow shows a security notice that covers: single-operator boundary; shared delegated authority when multiple people message the same instance; restricting channels and users (allowlists); using separate config/credentials and OS users or hosts per trust boundary; least privilege and sandboxing; keeping secrets out of the working directory and skill-accessible paths; and reviewing config and skills regularly. When updating either this document or the `SECURITY_WARNING` in `src/copaw/cli/init_cmd.py`, keep the **concepts and recommendations** consistent so operators get the same message in both places.

## Security & Trust

Security handling is owned by the CoPaw maintainers. For sensitive reports, use the private advisory or a private channel as above.

## Bug Bounties

CoPaw is a community open-source project. There is no bug bounty program and no budget for paid reports. Please still disclose responsibly so we can fix issues quickly. The best way to help the project right now is by sending PRs or clear, reproducible reports.

## Operator Trust Model

CoPaw does **not** model one instance as a multi-tenant, adversarial user boundary.

- Authenticated callers to the same CoPaw instance (same config, same channel workspace) are treated as **trusted operators** for that instance.
- Session identifiers and labels are routing/context controls, not per-user authorization boundaries.
- If one operator can see or trigger what another operator can on the same instance, that is expected in this trust model.
- **Recommended mode**: one user per machine/host (or per OS user), one CoPaw config for that user, and one or more agents/skills inside that instance.
- If multiple users need CoPaw, use one host/OS user (or VPS) per user, or strict isolation; sharing one instance by mutually untrusted users is not the recommended default.
- Skills run with the same privileges as the CoPaw process; only install and enable skills you trust.


## Trusted Skills Concept

Skills/extensions are part of CoPaw's **trusted computing base** for an instance.

- Installing or enabling a skill grants it the same trust level as local code running for that instance.
- Skill behavior such as reading env/files or running host commands is expected inside this trust boundary.
- Security reports must show a **boundary bypass** (e.g. unauthenticated skill load, allowlist/policy bypass, or path-safety bypass), not only malicious behavior from a trusted-installed skill.

## Out of Scope

- Public internet exposure of CoPaw when the docs recommend against it.
- Using CoPaw in ways that the docs recommend not to.
- Deployments where mutually untrusted/adversarial operators share one CoPaw instance and config (e.g. reports expecting per-operator isolation for sessions, history, or similar).
- **Prompt-injection-only** attacks (without a policy/auth/sandbox boundary bypass).
- Reports that require write access to trusted local state (working directory, config, memory files) to achieve impact.
- Reports where the only demonstrated impact is an already-authorized user intentionally invoking a skill or command that writes to an allowed path, without bypassing auth, sandbox, or another documented boundary.
- Reports where the only claim is that a trusted-installed/enabled skill can execute with process/host privileges (documented trust model behavior).
- Any report whose only claim is that an operator-enabled “dangerous” or break-glass option weakens defaults (these are explicit tradeoffs by design).
- Reports that depend on trusted operator–supplied configuration to trigger availability impact (e.g. custom regex or patterns). These may still be fixed as defense-in-depth but are not security-boundary bypasses.
- Exposed secrets that are third-party or user-controlled credentials (not CoPaw-owned and not granting access to CoPaw-operated infrastructure) without demonstrated CoPaw impact.
- Scanner-only claims against stale or nonexistent paths, or without a working repro.

## Deployment Assumptions

CoPaw security guidance assumes:

- The host where CoPaw runs is within a trusted OS/admin boundary.
- Anyone who can modify the CoPaw working directory and config (including `config.json`) is effectively a trusted operator.
- A single instance shared by mutually untrusted people is **not** a recommended setup. Use separate configs and, at minimum, separate OS users or hosts per trust boundary.
- Authenticated callers to the same instance are treated as trusted operators; session or context identifiers are routing controls, not per-user authorization boundaries.
- Multiple instances can run on one machine, but the recommended model is clean per-user isolation (prefer one host/OS user per user).

## One-User Trust Model

CoPaw's security model is **“personal assistant”** (one trusted operator, potentially many agents/skills), not “shared multi-tenant bus.”

- If multiple people can message the same tool-enabled CoPaw instance (e.g. a shared channel workspace), they can all steer that agent within its granted permissions.
- Session or memory scoping reduces context bleed but does **not** create per-user host authorization boundaries.
- For mixed-trust or adversarial users, isolate by OS user/host and use separate config and credentials per boundary.
- A company-shared agent can be valid when users are in the same trust boundary and the agent is strictly business-only.
- For company-shared setups, use a dedicated machine/VM/container and dedicated accounts; avoid mixing personal data on that runtime.
- If that host or environment is logged into personal accounts (e.g. personal password manager, personal cloud), you have collapsed the boundary and increased personal-data exposure risk.

## Agent and Model Assumptions

- The model/agent is **not** a trusted principal. Assume prompt/content injection can manipulate behavior.
- Security boundaries come from host/config trust, channel/user allowlists, tool policy, and what skills are enabled.
- Prompt injection by itself is not a vulnerability report unless it crosses one of those boundaries.

## Working Directory and Config Trust Boundary

The CoPaw working directory is treated as **trusted local operator state**.

- If someone can edit working directory files or config, they have already crossed the trusted operator boundary.
- Memory or context over those files is expected behavior, not a separate security boundary.
- Example out-of-scope pattern: “attacker writes malicious content into workspace files, then the agent uses it.” If you need isolation between mutually untrusted users, split by OS user or host and run separate instances.
- Keep secrets out of the working directory and skill-accessible paths; this is part of the baseline recommended in `copaw init`.

## Skills Trust Boundary

Skills are loaded and run **in-process** (or under the same trust boundary) as the CoPaw runtime and are treated as trusted code.

- Skills can execute with the same OS privileges as the CoPaw process.
- Runtime helpers used by skills are convenience APIs, not a sandbox boundary.
- Only install skills you trust, and restrict which skills are enabled in config where possible.

## Operational Guidance

- **Channels and users**: Restrict which channels and users can trigger the agent; use allowlists where possible.
- **Multi-user or shared inbox**: Use separate config/credentials and ideally separate OS users or hosts per trust boundary.
- **Skills**: Run with least privilege; sandbox where you can; limit tool scope to what you need.
- **Secrets**: Keep them out of the agent's working directory and skill-accessible paths.
- **Model**: Use a capable model when the agent has tools or handles untrusted input.
- **Review**: Review your config and skills regularly.

For more operational and hardening guidance, see the [documentation](http://copaw.agentscope.io/) and any security-related docs linked from the repo.

## Runtime Requirements

- **Python**: CoPaw requires a supported Python version (see [README](README.md)). Use a version with current security updates.
- **Docker or restricted environments**: When running in containers, run as a non-root user when possible. Use read-only mounts where feasible and limit capabilities to what is needed.

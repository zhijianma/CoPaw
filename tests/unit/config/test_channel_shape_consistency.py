"""Consistency guards for built-in channel shape declarations.

A built-in channel is declared in more than one place, and those places
must stay in sync.  ``ChannelConfig`` is the source of truth for the
config shape (this is what doctor already walks), while the registry
and the API layer keep their own lists.

These tests fail loudly when a newly added channel is missing from one
of those lists.  That drift is what made ``GET`` on a single channel
answer with an unrelated channel's fields for ``onebot``, and what let
``PUT`` write an unvalidated dict to disk.

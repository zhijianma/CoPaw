# Terminal UI (TUI)

The QwenPaw **TUI** is a full-screen chat interface that runs entirely in your terminal. It talks to the _same_ agent as the Console and the IM Channels — same memory, same skills, same MCP tools, same sessions — but without leaving the keyboard. If you live in a terminal, this is the fastest way to chat with your agent, drive a task, or pick up a session you started somewhere else.

It is also the most natural surface for **Coding Mode**: launch it from inside a repo and the agent treats that directory as its workshop.

## Launching

The TUI ships with the `qwenpaw` CLI. Running `qwenpaw` with no arguments opens it directly:

```bash
qwenpaw                       # open a chat with the active agent
qwenpaw tui                   # same thing, with explicit options
qwenpaw tui --agent NAME      # chat with a specific agent
qwenpaw tui --resume <id>     # resume a previous session and continue it
```

To start a **project-bound (Coding Mode)** session, point it at a directory:

```bash
qwenpaw .                     # use the current directory as the project
qwenpaw tui /path/to/repo     # use an explicit directory
```

This enables Coding-Mode prompt and tool behavior **for that TUI session only** — it does not change the project saved in `agent.json` or selected in the Console.

> No separate install or server to manage: the TUI launches its own `qwenpaw acp` backend using the interpreter it ships in, so it always drives the same install/venv as your `qwenpaw` command.

## The Layout

| Area                    | What it shows                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Status bar** (top)    | The current agent, model, session id, running token usage (`tok ↑in ↓out`), and a busy/ready indicator.                                                                            |
| **Transcript** (middle) | The conversation — your messages, the agent's replies, collapsible _thinking_ and _tool call_ panels, plans, and file links.                                                       |
| **Prompt** (bottom)     | Where you type. The hint line reminds you of the core gestures: `/` for commands, `enter` to send, `shift+enter` for a newline, `esc` to interrupt, and paste for files/long text. |

---

## Basic Features

**Streaming chat.** Replies stream in token by token. The agent's reasoning and each tool call appear as collapsible panels so you can follow along or fold them away.

**Queue while busy.** You don't have to wait for a turn to finish. Type and press `enter` and your message is **queued**, then sent automatically when the current turn ends. Press `up` to recall and edit the last queued message.

**Interrupt.** Press `esc` to cancel the in-flight turn (or clear the input if you haven't sent anything yet).

**Sessions & resume.** Every chat is a session shared with the rest of QwenPaw. Use `/resume` to pick a recent session from the suggestions, or `/resume list` to browse all of them. You can also resume on launch with `qwenpaw tui --resume <id>`.

**Paste files & long text.** Paste an image or a file path and the TUI attaches it for the agent; paste a long block of text and it is stored as an attachment instead of flooding the prompt. Works with `data:` URLs too.

**Tool permissions.** When the agent wants to run a tool that needs your approval, an inline permission prompt appears — approve or deny without leaving the TUI.

**Inspection mode.** Toggle `/inspect` (or `ctrl+i`) to reveal deeper thought and tool-call detail when you want to see exactly what the agent is doing.

**Themes.** Run `/theme` to open the gallery, or `/theme <vibe>` to repaint the background to a named theme or a free-form prompt.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key                 | Action                                              |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `enter`             | Send the message (or queue it if the agent is busy) |
| `shift+enter`       | Insert a newline                                    |
| `esc`               | Interrupt the current turn / clear the input        |
| `up`                | Recall and edit the last queued message             |
| `ctrl+i`            | Toggle inspection (deeper thought/tool detail)      |
| `ctrl+t`            | Hide / show tool-call panels                        |
| `ctrl+c` / `ctrl+q` | Quit                                                |

## Slash Commands

Type `/` in the prompt to get inline auto-suggestions. There are two kinds of commands.

### Handled by the TUI

These control the terminal interface itself:

| Command    | Purpose                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/help`    | Show the TUI shortcuts and command hints                |
| `/resume`  | Resume a recent session (`/resume list` to browse all)  |
| `/theme`   | Open the theme gallery, or `/theme <vibe>` to apply one |
| `/inspect` | Toggle deeper thought / tool-call detail                |

### Handled by the agent

Everything else you type starting with `/` is forwarded to the QwenPaw agent — the **same magic commands** available in the Console and Channels, for example `/model`, `/clear`, `/compact`, `/skills`, and `/status`. The TUI advertises whatever commands the connected agent supports, so the suggestion list always matches your agent. See [Magic Commands](/docs/commands) for the full catalog.

## How It Works

You don't need to know the internals to use the TUI, but a one-paragraph mental model helps explain why sessions, memory, and tools "just work" the same as everywhere else.

The TUI is a thin **client**. It is a [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) terminal app that drives a local QwenPaw backend over **ACP** (the [Agent Client Protocol](/docs/acp-integration)). On launch it spawns `qwenpaw acp` as a subprocess and speaks ACP to it; all the real work — the model calls, memory, skills, MCP tools, session storage — happens in that backend, exactly the same backend the Console and Channels use.

Two practical consequences:

- **Sessions are shared.** A chat you start in the TUI shows up in `/resume` later, and you can resume a session that originated in the Console or a Channel — it's all one session store.
- **The TUI stays light.** Because it only renders and forwards input, it starts fast and the heavy agent runtime lives in the backend process.

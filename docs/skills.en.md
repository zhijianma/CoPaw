# Skills

**Skills** can come from packaged built-ins, the local skill pool, the Skill
Market or URL imports, or files you add yourself.

Two ways to manage skills:

- **Console:** Use the [Console](./console) under **Workspace → Skills**.
- **Working directory:** Edit skill files directly under `$QWENPAW_WORKING_DIR`
  (default `~/.qwenpaw`), including `$QWENPAW_WORKING_DIR/skill_pool/` and each
  workspace's `$QWENPAW_WORKING_DIR/workspaces/{agent_id}/skills/`.

> If you're new to channels, heartbeat, or cron, read [Introduction](./intro) first.

Skills are organized between the shared pool and each workspace's local runtime
copies. The structure and creation paths are described below.

---

## Skill Structure

QwenPaw skills are organized in two layers:

- **Skill Pool:** Shared local repository at `$QWENPAW_WORKING_DIR/skill_pool/`
  (default `~/.qwenpaw/skill_pool/`).
- **Workspace Skills:** The local runtime copy at
  `$QWENPAW_WORKING_DIR/workspaces/{agent_id}/skills/`
  (default `~/.qwenpaw/workspaces/{agent_id}/skills/`).

```
$QWENPAW_WORKING_DIR/                      # Default ~/.qwenpaw
  skill_pool/                # Shared pool
    skill.json               # Pool manifest
    pdf/
      SKILL.md
    cron/
      SKILL.md
    my_shared_skill/
      SKILL.md
  workspaces/
    default/
      skill.json             # Workspace manifest
      skills/                # Runtime copies actually used by this workspace
        pdf/
          SKILL.md
        my_skill/
          SKILL.md
```

### Skill Pool

The pool is where built-ins and reusable shared skills live. Pool entries are
**not executed directly** by a workspace. To use one, you must broadcast it to
a workspace first.

Pool-side operations:

- **Broadcast:** Copy a pool skill into one or more workspaces.
- **Add to pool:** The pool page has a unified **Add Skill** entry (Create
  Skill, Upload via Zip, Upload via URL, Browse Market). You can also import
  built-ins, upload from a workspace, or place files on disk manually.
- **Edit / rename:** Saving a normal shared skill under the same name edits
  that pool entry in place. Saving it under a new name creates a renamed
  entry. Builtin skills cannot be customized in place under the same name. To
  customize a builtin, save it under a new name and keep the builtin slot
  untouched.
- **Conflict handling:** If save, import, upload, or broadcast would land on a
  name that already exists, QwenPaw returns a conflict instead of silently
  overwriting. The UI/API includes a suggested renamed target so you can retry
  with that name.
- **Auto sync:** Once enabled for a skill, any change to its pool content is
  pushed to the relevant workspaces automatically (see **Auto sync** below).

Adding skills to the pool:

1. **Import built-ins**.
   Built-in skill IDs come from packaged skill directory names.

   | Skill ID                      | Description                                                                                                                              | Source                                                         |

   In the pool UI, built-ins can show statuses such as **up-to-date** or
   **out-of-date**. Use **Update Built-in Skills** to add missing built-ins
   or refresh out-of-date ones from the packaged source.

   The **Cron** built-in provides scheduled job management. Use the
   [CLI](./cli) (`qwenpaw cron`) or Console **Control → Cron Jobs**:

   - Create: `qwenpaw cron create --type agent --name "xxx" --cron "0 9 * * *" ...`
   - List: `qwenpaw cron list`
   - Check state: `qwenpaw cron state <job_id>`

2. **Through the unified "Add Skill" entry**.
   The **Add Skill** dropdown at the top right of the pool page offers four
   ways:

   - **Create Skill**: creates a shared pool skill without first creating it
     in a workspace.
   - **Upload via Zip**: import one or more packaged skill folders.
   - **Upload via URL**: import directly from supported Hub / GitHub URLs.
   - **Browse Market**: switch to the embedded Skill Market; clicking **Save**
     on a card saves it into the pool (see **Skill Market** below).

3. **Upload from a workspace**.
   On **Workspace → Skills**, click **Sync to Skill Pool** to publish a workspace skill to the
   pool.

4. **Manual filesystem changes**.
   You can place folders directly under `$QWENPAW_WORKING_DIR/skill_pool/`, but this is not
   recommended. Direct pool edits can be lost or overwritten more easily,
   especially for customized skills. Be careful and treat this as an advanced
   workflow.

### External skill paths

By default the skill pool has a single root: the primary pool at
`$QWENPAW_WORKING_DIR/skill_pool/`. You can also register one or more **external skill
roots** in the config so QwenPaw reads the skills they contain into the **same skill pool
view**. This is useful for reusing skill collections already on your machine (a git repo,
a shared team folder) without copying them into the primary pool.

What external paths mean:

- **One pool, multiple roots.** Skills under an external directory are not copied into the
  primary pool; they are read in place and appear in the pool alongside the primary skills.
  On-disk changes are reflected on the next load.
- **Order is priority.** Scan order is the primary pool first, then each entry in
  `skill_paths` in order. If two roots contain a skill with the same name, the **earlier one
  wins**; the later duplicate is shadowed and skipped (a warning is logged).
- **What you can do with external skills.** List, view, broadcast / download to a workspace,
  edit in place (save / rename writes back to the external directory), and delete (which
  **physically removes the files under the external directory**). In the Skill Pool UI, an
  external skill's **installed-from** field shows its external path so you can recognize it.
- **No metadata written to external dirs.** The pool's `skill.json` index lives only in the
  primary pool and is rebuilt from disk and self-heals; external directories are left
  untouched and never get a manifest written to them.
- **Uploads / imports always land in the primary pool.** Sync from a workspace, import from
  zip, and import from URL all write to the primary pool, never to an external path.

#### How to configure

Edit `$QWENPAW_WORKING_DIR/config.json` and add the top-level `skill_paths` field:

```json
{
  "skill_paths": ["~/my-skills", "/opt/team/shared-skills"]
}
```

Notes:

- The array is ordered; the order decides the conflict priority described above.
- Paths support `~` expansion to the home directory.
- Missing or invalid paths are silently skipped.
- After saving, external skills appear on the next skill pool load (a refresh, a restart,
  or any endpoint that triggers it).

`$QWENPAW_WORKING_DIR` defaults to `~/.qwenpaw` and can be overridden with the
`QWENPAW_WORKING_DIR` environment variable. See [Config](./config) for the full
configuration reference.

### Workspace Skills

Every workspace runs from its own local copies under
`$QWENPAW_WORKING_DIR/workspaces/{agent_id}/skills/`. Those copies are what the agent
actually loads at runtime.

---

## Workspace

The **Add Skill** dropdown at the top right of [Console](./console) →
**Workspace → Skills** is the unified entry; skills added through it are
**enabled by default**:

- **Load from Skill Pool**: pick the skills to load and confirm. This is the
  preferred path for built-ins and shared reusable skills (the reverse
  direction also works: click **Broadcast** on a skill in **Settings → Skill
  Pool**). Name conflicts return an error with a suggested renamed target.
- **Create Skill**: enter a name and content; the new skill is written into
  the workspace's `skills/` directory and `skill.json`. The edit drawer also
  offers **AI Optimize** (**beta**) — it may help rewrite content but does not
  guarantee a working result; review before saving.
- **Upload via Zip**: import one or more packaged skill folders.
- **Upload via URL**: import from supported Hub / GitHub URLs — see **Import
  from URL** below.
- **Browse Market**: switch to the embedded Skill Market and click **Save** on
  a card to install it into the current workspace — see
  [Skill Market](#skill-market) below.

Beyond that page, you can also write files manually or generate a skill from
the current session with `/make-skill`, described below.

### Import from URL

The workspace skill page supports importing from the following URL sources:

- `https://skills.sh/...`
- `https://clawhub.ai/...`
- `https://skillsmp.com/...`
- `https://lobehub.com/...`
- `https://market.lobehub.com/...` (LobeHub direct download endpoint)
- `https://github.com/...`
- `https://modelscope.cn/skills/...`

CLI supports the same URL-based import flow:

**Workspace targeting:** use `--agent-id` when targeting a single agent workspace; without it, `install` / `uninstall` act on the skill pool.

```bash
qwenpaw skills install <skill_url>
qwenpaw skills install <skill_url> --agent-id <agent_id>
```

CLI also supports uninstalling from the shared pool or one workspace:

```bash
qwenpaw skills uninstall <skill_name>
qwenpaw skills uninstall <skill_name> --agent-id <agent_id>
```

#### Steps

1. In [Console](./console) → **Workspace → Skills**, click **Add Skill →
   Upload via URL**.

   ![skill](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN018GbM8v1Iuyyp9Cuyp_!!6000000000954-2-tps-3822-2070.png)

2. Paste a skill URL in the pop-up window (see **URL acquisition example**
   below). The dialog lists the supported sources with an example URL for
   each — click an example to fill it in.

   ![url](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/O1CN01ztz7ds28L7zh408Si_!!6000000007915-2-tps-3822-2070.png)

3. Click **Confirm** and wait for import to finish.

   ![click](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN01FXICJa1fcsUDbQpiv_!!6000000004028-2-tps-3822-2070.png)

4. After a successful import, the skill appears in the skill list and is
   **enabled by default**.

   ![check](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i1/O1CN01qamRgj1DHzB63zl9e_!!6000000000192-2-tps-3822-2070.png)

#### URL acquisition example

1. Open a supported marketplace page (e.g. `skills.sh`; the same flow applies
   to `clawhub.ai`, `skillsmp.com`, `lobehub.com`, `modelscope.cn`).
2. Pick the skill you need (e.g. `find-skills`).

   ![find](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/O1CN015bgbAR1ph8JbtTsIY_!!6000000005391-2-tps-3410-2064.png)

3. Copy the URL from the address bar — this is the Skill URL used for import.

   ![url](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN01d1l5kO1wgrODXukNV_!!6000000006338-2-tps-3410-2064.png)

   LobeHub also exposes a direct download endpoint on
   `https://market.lobehub.com/...`, which is accepted as well.

4. To import from GitHub, open a page containing `SKILL.md` (e.g.
   `skill-creator` in the anthropics skills repo) and copy the URL.

   ![github](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN0117GbZa1lLN24GNpqI_!!6000000004802-2-tps-3410-2064.png)

#### Notes

- If a skill with the same name already exists, import does not overwrite.
  Check the existing one first.
- If import fails, check URL completeness, supported domains, and outbound
  network access. If GitHub rate-limits requests, add `GITHUB_TOKEN` in
  Console → Settings → Environments. See GitHub docs:
  [Managing your personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

### Create manually in the workspace

You can also create a workspace skill directly by writing files under
`$QWENPAW_WORKING_DIR/workspaces/{agent_id}/skills/`, including using QwenPaw itself to help
generate those files.

This is flexible, but the write location and resulting skill quality are not
always fully controlled. You should supervise the creation process carefully,
verify that files land in the right workspace path, and review the skill
content before relying on it.

Create a directory under `$QWENPAW_WORKING_DIR/workspaces/{agent_id}/skills/`, add a
`SKILL.md`, and make sure it includes YAML front matter with `name` and
`description`. If the skill depends on external binaries or environment
variables, declare them in `metadata.requires`; QwenPaw exposes them as
`require_bins` and `require_envs` metadata, but does not disable the skill
automatically.

#### Example SKILL.md

```markdown
---
name: my_skill
description: My custom capability
metadata:
  requires:
    bins: [ffmpeg]
    env: [MY_SKILL_API_KEY]
---

# Usage

This skill is used for…
```

`name` and `description` are **required**. `metadata` is optional.

Manually placed skills are detected on the next manifest reconcile and added
to `skill.json` as **disabled**. Enable them in the Console or CLI.

### Create from current session via /make-skill (Beta)

When you've just walked through a workflow in chat: tried tools, hit
errors, found a working approach.
Turn that session into a skill:

```
/make-skill cooking
```

You'll see a short plan card with the proposed skill name and step
outline. Approve, refine, or cancel in natural language. After approval
the agent writes the skill based on the conversation and saves it to
your workspace, **enabled by default**.

`<focus>` becomes the skill name; internal spaces collapse to `-`
(e.g. `view image debug` → `view-image-debug`). Other characters
(Chinese, case, digits) are kept as-is.

`/make-skill` is itself a built-in skill — make sure it's enabled in
your workspace via `/skills` before invoking.

### Auto sync (Skill Pool & Workspace)

Turn on **Auto sync** for a pool skill and any change to its pool content is
synced to the relevant workspaces automatically — no manual broadcast needed.

- **How to enable:** Toggle it on the skill card in **Settings → Skill Pool**
  (applies immediately), or enable it and pick associated agents in the skill
  drawer (applies on save).
- **Sync scope:**
  - **Default** (no associated agents configured): syncs only to workspaces that
    **already have the skill**; agents that never had it are not installed.
  - **Explicit agents:** syncs to exactly those agents; ones in the list that
    lack the skill get it installed, while agents not listed are left untouched.
- **Change detection:** based on the content of `SKILL.md`.
- **Inbox notification:** each run posts one message to the [Inbox](./console)
  listing which agents each skill was synced to (sender shown as "Skill Pool").

---

Common workspace operations:

- **Enable / disable:** Turn a skill on or off without changing its files.
- **Delete:** Delete a workspace skill. If the skill is currently enabled, it
  is automatically disabled first.
- **Sync to Skill Pool:** Publish a workspace skill to the shared pool for
  reuse by other workspaces.
- **Edit channel scope / config:** Adjust where the skill applies and what
  runtime config it receives in this workspace.

---

## Skill Market

Search and install skills from multiple marketplaces in one place. The market
is embedded in the skill pages: on **Workspace → Skills** or **Settings →
Skill Pool**, click **Add Skill → Browse Market** to switch to the market view
(click **Back** or use browser back to return to the list). This is the
search-driven alternative to the per-URL **Import from URL** flow above.

Four providers ship out of the box:

- **QwenPaw** — public, always enabled.
- **ClawHub** — public, always enabled.
- **ModelScope** — public, always enabled.
- **Aliyun** — requires `ALIBABA_CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY_ID` /
  `ALIBABA_CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET` in **Settings → Environments**;
  without them the provider chip is disabled and the tooltip explains why.

How it works:

- Filter by **provider**, **category**, and keyword; categories map to each
  provider's native category codes or equivalent search terms automatically.
- Search runs across all enabled providers in parallel; one provider failing
  doesn't block results from the others.
- **Save** installs to where you entered from: the current workspace (from
  **Workspace → Skills**) or the pool (from **Settings → Skill Pool**).
- Installs run through a queue (one at a time) with retry and cancel; name conflicts surface as a failed item with the server message — rename the existing workspace skill and retry the install.

After install, every skill remembers its origin in an `installed_from` field, shown in the skill drawer as **Installed from**. Values include `clawhub`,
`modelscope`, `aliyun`, `skills-sh`, `lobehub`, `skillsmp`, `github`, `url`, `zip`. Skills with no recorded origin (built-ins, hand-created, legacy entries) display an empty value.

The per-URL **Import from URL** flow above remains the way to pull from sources not covered by these search providers (skills.sh, lobehub.com, github.com, etc.).

---

## Channel routing

Each skill can be restricted to specific channels. By default, skills apply to
**all channels** (`channels: ["all"]`).

To limit a skill to certain channels:

1. In **Workspace → Skills**, click the channel setting on a skill.
2. Select the channels where this skill should be active (e.g. `discord`,
   `telegram`, `console`).

When the agent runs on a given channel, only skills whose `channels` list
includes that channel (or `"all"`) are loaded. This lets you keep
channel-specific skills. For example, a DingTalk-only onboarding skill does
not need to appear on Discord.

---

## Skill config

Each skill can have a `config` object stored in its manifest entry. This config
is not just stored metadata. When a skill is effective for the current
workspace and channel, QwenPaw injects that config into the runtime environment
for that agent turn, then restores the environment after the turn completes.

You can set config per skill in the Console (**Workspace → Skills** → click the
config icon on a skill) or via the API.

### How it works

Config keys that match a `metadata.requires.env` entry in SKILL.md are
injected as environment variables. Keys not declared in `requires.env` are
skipped (but still available via the full JSON variable). If a required key
is missing from the config, a warning is logged.

The full config is always available as `QWENPAW_SKILL_CONFIG_<SKILL_NAME>`
(JSON string), regardless of `requires.env`.

Existing host environment variables are never overwritten.

### Example

If `SKILL.md` declares:

```markdown
---
name: my_skill
description: demo
metadata:
  requires:
    env: [MY_API_KEY, BASE_URL]
---
```

And the config is:

```json
{
  "MY_API_KEY": "sk-demo",
  "BASE_URL": "https://api.example.com",
  "timeout": 30
}
```

The skill can read:

- `MY_API_KEY` comes from config and matches `requires.env`.
- `BASE_URL` comes from config and matches `requires.env`.
- `timeout` is not in `requires.env`, so it is only available via the full
  JSON below.
- `QWENPAW_SKILL_CONFIG_MY_SKILL` always contains the full JSON config.

Python example:

```python
import json
import os

api_key = os.environ.get("MY_API_KEY", "")
base_url = os.environ.get("BASE_URL", "")
cfg = json.loads(os.environ.get("QWENPAW_SKILL_CONFIG_MY_SKILL", "{}"))
timeout = cfg.get("timeout", 30)
```

Config is also preserved across pool ↔ workspace sync: uploading a workspace
skill copies its config to the pool entry, and downloading copies the pool
config into the workspace entry.

### Config priority

When a skill runs, the effective config follows this priority (highest wins):

1. **Host environment:** Existing env vars on the machine are never
   overwritten.
2. **Workspace config:** The `config` object in the workspace manifest entry
   (`skill.json`). This is what you edit in the Console per agent.
3. **Pool config:** When downloading a pool skill to a workspace, the pool's
   `config` is copied as the initial workspace config. Subsequent workspace
   edits take precedence.

For `requires` metadata, the parser checks keys in order: `metadata.openclaw.requires` → `metadata.qwenpaw.requires` → `metadata.requires`. The first one found is used.

---

## Upgrading from Earlier Versions

Converts legacy `active_skills/` and `customized_skills/` directories into the
unified workspace `skills/` layout.

Migration runs automatically on first start. Skills are **copied**, not moved —
the original `active_skills/` and `customized_skills/` directories are
preserved. Back up any important custom skill content before upgrading.
Migration reduces manual work, but you should still manage valuable skills
carefully and keep your own copies when needed. After verifying the migration
result, you can manually delete the old directories. **Skills in the old
`active_skills/` and `customized_skills/` directories are no longer read.**

| Before               | After                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `active_skills/`     | Workspace `skills/` (enabled)                                            |
| `customized_skills/` | Workspace `skills/` (disabled unless also active with identical content) |

If the same skill name exists in both directories with **different content**,
both copies are kept with `-active` / `-customize` suffixes. To share a
workspace skill across agents, upload it to the skill pool via the UI.

```
docker pull agentscope/copaw:latest
docker run -p 8088:8088 -v copaw-data:/app/working agentscope/copaw:latest
```

### How to update CoPaw

To update CoPaw, use the method matching your installation type:

1. If installed via one-line script, re-run the installer to upgrade.

2. If installed via pip, run:

```
pip install --upgrade copaw
```

3. If installed from source, pull the latest code and reinstall:

```
cd CoPaw
git pull origin main
pip install -e .
```

4. If using Docker, pull the latest image and restart the container:

```
docker pull agentscope/copaw:latest
docker run -p 8088:8088 -v copaw-data:/app/working agentscope/copaw:latest
```

After upgrading, restart the service with `copaw app`.

### How to initialize and start CoPaw service

Recommended quick initialization:

```bash
copaw init --defaults
```

Start service:

```bash
copaw app
```

The default Console URL is `http://127.0.0.1:8088/`. After quick init, you can
open Console and customize settings. See
[Quick Start](https://copaw.agentscope.io/docs/quickstart).

### Open-source repository

CoPaw is open source. Official repository:
`https://github.com/agentscope-ai/CoPaw`

### Where to check latest version upgrade details

You can check version changes in CoPaw GitHub
[Releases](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/CoPaw/releases).

### How to configure models

In Console, go to **Settings -> Models**. See
[Console -> Models](https://copaw.agentscope.io/docs/console#models) for
details.

- Cloud models: fill provider API key (ModelScope, DashScope, or custom), then
  choose the active model.
- Local models: supports `llama.cpp`, `MLX`, and Ollama. After download, select
  the active model on the same page.

You can also use `copaw models` CLI commands for configuration, download, and
switching. See
[CLI -> Models and Environment Variables -> copaw models](https://copaw.agentscope.io/docs/cli#copaw-models).

### How to manage Skills

Go to **Agent -> Skills** in Console. You can enable/disable Skills, create
custom Skills, and import Skills from Skills Hub. See
[Skills](https://copaw.agentscope.io/docs/skills).

### How to configure MCP

Go to **Agent -> MCP** in Console. You can enable/disable/delete/create MCP
clients there. See [MCP](https://copaw.agentscope.io/docs/mcp).

### Common error

1. Error pattern: `You didn't provide an API key`

Error detail:

```
Error: Unknown agent error: AuthenticationError: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': "You didn't provide an API key. You need to provide your API key in an Authorization header using Bearer auth (i.e. Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY). ", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': None}, 'request_id': 'xxx'}
```

Cause 1: model API key is not configured. Get an API key and configure it in
**Console -> Settings -> Models**.

Cause 2: key is configured but still fails. In most cases, one of the
configuration fields is incorrect (for example `base_url`, `api key`, or model
name).

CoPaw supports API keys obtained via DashScope Coding Plan. If it still fails,
please check:

- whether `base_url` is correct;
- whether the API key is copied completely (no extra spaces);
- whether the model name exactly matches the provider value (case-sensitive).

### How to get support when errors occur

To speed up troubleshooting and fixes, please create an issue in the CoPaw
GitHub repository and include complete error information:
https://github.com/agentscope-ai/CoPaw/issues

In many Console errors, a detailed error file path is included. For example:

Error: Unknown agent error: AuthenticationError: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': "You didn't provide an API key. You need to provide your API key in an Authorization header using Bearer auth (i.e. Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY). ", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': None}, 'request_id': 'xxx'}(Details: /var/folders/.../copaw_query_error_qzbx1mv1.json)

Please upload that file (for example
`/var/folders/.../copaw_query_error_qzbx1mv1.json`) together with your current
model provider, model name, and exact CoPaw version.

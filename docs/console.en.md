## Chat

> Sidebar: **Chat → Chat**

This is where you talk to QwenPaw. It is the default page when the Console opens.

![Chat](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN01EP1ra01iOAcBvF0TC_!!6000000004402-2-tps-3822-2070.png)

**Choose a model:**
Use the control at the **top-right** of the chat page to pick the model for the
current agent.

**Send a message:**
Type in the input box at the bottom, then press **Enter** or click the send
button (↑). QwenPaw replies in real time.

**Voice input:**
The composer supports **voice input** (browser and OS microphone permission
required). Behavior matches **Voice transcription** settings (e.g. transcribe
first, then send text to the model).

**Attachments:**
You can attach **files** such as documents, images, and audio/video (follow
on-screen limits; per-file size caps apply).

**Create a new session:**
Click the **New Chat** button at the top-right of the chat page to start a new
conversation. Each session keeps separate history.

**Switch sessions:**
Click the **Chat history** button at the top-right to view and switch between
past conversations.

**Delete a session:**
In the chat history panel, click the **trash** button on the right of a session
row to delete it.

## Inbox

> Sidebar: **Inbox → Inbox**

Inbox is the centralized place to handle approvals and review execution results
from cron jobs and heartbeat runs.

**Unread indicator:**
The Inbox entry shows an unread dot. Open Inbox regularly to avoid missing
important notifications.

**Approvals:**
Approval-required actions triggered from any agent chat in the Console channel
appear in the Inbox approval page.

![todo](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN01sVXgDs1uRd07B7u7a_!!6000000006034-2-tps-2926-1860.png)

You can handle approvals from all agents in one place (approve / reject /
cancel task). Approval cards include a countdown; if no action is taken before
timeout, the request is **rejected by default**. Actions taken here stay in sync
with approval popups in chat.

**Push messages:**
For cron jobs and heartbeat, users can choose whether execution results should
be pushed to Inbox. Click a message to view execution details, including traces.

![todo](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN01iC21Ec20wD8uObwi2_!!6000000006913-2-tps-2886-1878.png)

---

## Channels

> Sidebar: **Control → Channels**

Manage messaging channels (Console, DingTalk, Feishu, Discord, QQ, WeChat,
iMessage, etc.): enable/disable and credentials.

![Channels](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN01ieCEb91uiZfJ6Zz5V_!!6000000006071-2-tps-3810-2064.png)

Open the same panel, turn off **Enable**, then click **Save**.

> For credential setup details, see [Channels](./channels).

---

## Sessions

> Sidebar: **Control → Sessions**

View, filter, and clean up chat sessions across all channels.

![Sessions](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/O1CN01PY9Yhe25Pl9TuEBfz_!!6000000007519-2-tps-3822-2070.png)

## Cron Jobs

> Sidebar: **Control → Cron Jobs**

Create and manage scheduled jobs that QwenPaw runs automatically by time.

![Cron Jobs](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN01WsQvrb1dKthp8QMvd_!!6000000003718-2-tps-3822-2070.png)

**Create a new job:**

> If the cron job fails to be created, please refer to the **Troubleshooting Scheduled (Cron) Tasks** section in the [FAQ](https://qwenpaw.agentscope.io/docs/faq) to identify the cause.

The **simplest way to create a cron job is to chat directly with QwenPaw** and let it handle the creation for you. For example, if you want to receive a reminder to drink water on DingTalk, simply message QwenPaw on DingTalk: "Help me create a cron job to remind me to drink water every 5 minutes." Once created, you can view the new task on the Cron Jobs page in the console.

Alternatively, you can create tasks directly via the Console interface:

1. Click **+ Create Job**.
2. Fill in each section:
   - **Basic info** — Job ID (e.g. `job-001`), display name (e.g. "Daily summary"),
     and enable the job.
   - **Schedule** — Pick a schedule; if presets are not enough, enter a **cron
     expression** (five fields, e.g. `0 9 * * *` = 9:00 daily). Timezone defaults
     to the current agent's user timezone; you can change it here.
   - **Task type & content** — **Text**: send fixed text from **Message content**.
     **Agent**: fill **Request content**; on each run QwenPaw receives the text
     from `content.text` as the request.
   - **Delivery** — Target channel (Console, DingTalk, etc.), target user,
     target session id, and mode (**Stream** = token stream, **Final** = one
     complete reply).
   - **Advanced** — Optional: max concurrency, timeout, misfire grace time.
3. Click **Save**.

**Enable/disable a job:**
Toggle the switch in the row.

**Edit a job:**
**Disable** the job first, click **Edit** → change fields → **Save**.

**Run once immediately:**
Click **Execute Now** → confirm.

**Delete a job:**
**Disable** the job first, click **Delete** → confirm.

---

## Heartbeat

> Sidebar: **Control → Heartbeat**

![Heartbeat](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i1/O1CN017fS5GW1jIxj8FuQXl_!!6000000004526-2-tps-3822-2070.png)

Configure periodic "self-check" for the **currently selected agent**: on each
tick, send the contents of `HEARTBEAT.md` as a user message to QwenPaw, and
optionally deliver the reply to a chosen target.

**Common options:**

- **Enable** — Must be on for the schedule to run.
- **Interval** — Number + unit (minutes / hours).
- **Delivery target** — `main` runs in the main session only; `last` can send
  results to the channel from your last user conversation.
- **Active hours** (optional) — Only fire within a daily window to avoid night
  noise.

Click **Save** to apply. See [Heartbeat](./heartbeat) for wording and semantics.

---

## Files

> Sidebar: **Workspace → Files**

Edit files that define QwenPaw's persona and behavior — `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
`HEARTBEAT.md`, etc. — directly in the browser.

> **Multi-agent:** Starting from **v0.1.0**, QwenPaw supports **multi-agent** mode.
> You can run multiple independent agents in one QwenPaw instance, each with its own
> workspace, configuration, memory, and history. Agents can collaborate. Use the
> switcher at the top of the Console to change the active agent. See
> [Multi-Agent](./multi-agent).

![Files](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/O1CN01iEhSJL1cHP4JHPdio_!!6000000003575-2-tps-3822-2070.png)

Configure the default action when a tool reaches its offload deadline:

- **Keep Foreground** (product default) — do not auto-offload when the offload
  countdown ends; the tool keeps running in the chat foreground until it
  finishes or hits its execution timeout.
- **Auto Offload to Background** — when the offload countdown ends, move the
  call to the background so the agent can continue other work.

---

## Security

> Sidebar: **Settings → Security**

![Security](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/O1CN01oxB5ns1GH1BksHGtZ_!!6000000000596-2-tps-3822-2070.png)

View LLM token usage over a range, by date and model.

**View usage:**

1. Select a date range (default: last 30 days).
2. Click **Refresh** to fetch data.
3. The page shows total tokens, total calls, and breakdowns by model and date.

**Query via chat:**
Ask e.g. "How many tokens have I used?" or "Show token usage." The agent calls
`get_token_usage` and returns stats.

> Data is stored in `~/.qwenpaw/token_usage.json`. Override the filename with
> `QWENPAW_TOKEN_USAGE_FILE`. See [Config — Environment variables](./config#environment-variables).

## Voice transcription

> Sidebar: **Settings → Voice transcription**

![Voice transcription](https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN01ZdRtQq1TgkRa5kJhr_!!6000000002412-2-tps-3822-2070.png)

Configure how **voice/audio from channels** is handled before it reaches the
model (same settings apply to voice input in chat and channel voice messages).

- **Audio mode** — **Auto**: transcribe per settings below, then send text
  (works for most models). **Native**: send audio as an attachment (only for
  models that support audio).
- **Transcription backend** — **Off**; **Whisper API**; **Local Whisper**.

**Whisper API setup:**

1. Add an OpenAI-compatible provider under [Models](#models).
2. Make sure the provider supports `audio/transcriptions` and has a valid API
   key.
3. Return here and select that provider as the Whisper API backend.

**Local Whisper setup:**

1. Install `ffmpeg` with your system package manager.
2. Install the optional Python dependency in the environment that runs QwenPaw:
   `pip install "qwenpaw[whisper]"`.
3. Restart QwenPaw, then select **Local Whisper** here.

Verify the local installation with:

```bash
ffmpeg -version
python -c "import whisper; print('openai-whisper installed')"
```

**Save** applies to newly received audio. Follow on-page help for details.

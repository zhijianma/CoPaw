# Introduction

This page describes what CoPaw is, what it can do, and how to get started by
following the docs.

## What is CoPaw?

CoPAW is a **personal assistant** that runs in your own environment.

- **Multi-channel chat** — Talk to you via DingTalk, Feishu, QQ, Discord, iMessage, and more.
- **Scheduled execution** — Run tasks automatically on your configured schedule.
- **Driven by Skills — the possibilities are open-ended** — Built-in skills include cron (scheduled jobs), PDF and forms, Word/Excel/PPT handling, news digest, file reading, and more; add custom skills as described in [Skills](./skills).
- **All data stays local** — No third-party hosting.

CoPaw is built by the [AgentScope team](https://github.com/agentscope-ai) on
[AgentScope](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope),
[AgentScope Runtime](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope-runtime), and
[ReMe](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/ReMe).

## How do you use CoPaw?

You use CoPaw in two main ways:

1. **Chat in your messaging apps**
   Send messages in DingTalk, Feishu, QQ, Discord, or iMessage (Mac only); CoPaw replies
   in the same app and can look things up, manage todos, answer questions —
   whatever the enabled Skills support. One CoPaw instance can be connected to
   several apps; it replies in the channel where you last talked.

2. **Run on a schedule**
   Without sending a message each time, CoPaw can run at set times:
   - Send a fixed message to a channel (e.g. “Good morning” to DingTalk at 9am);
   - Ask CoPaw a question and send the answer to a channel (e.g. every 2 hours
     ask “What are my todos?” and post the reply to DingTalk);
   - Run a “check-in” or digest: ask CoPaw a block of questions you wrote and
     send the answer to the channel you last used.

After you install, connect at least one channel, and start the server, you can
chat with CoPaw in DingTalk, Feishu, QQ, etc. and use scheduled messages and check-ins;
what it actually does depends on which Skills you enable.

## Terms you’ll see in the docs

- **Channel** — Where you talk to CoPaw (DingTalk, Feishu, QQ, Discord, iMessage, etc.).
  Configure each in [Channels](./channels).
- **Heartbeat** — On a fixed interval, ask CoPaw a block of text you wrote and
  optionally send the answer to the channel you last used. See
  [Heartbeat](./heartbeat).
- **Cron jobs** — Scheduled tasks (send X at 9am, ask Y every 2h, etc.), managed
  via [CLI](./cli) or API.

Each term is explained in detail in its chapter.

## Suggested order

1. **[Quick start](./quickstart)** — Get the server running in three commands.
2. **[Console](./console)** — Once the server is running, **before configuring
   channels**, you can use the Console (open the root URL in your browser) to
   chat with CoPAW and configure the agent. This helps you see how CoPAW works.
3. **Configure and use as needed**:
   - [Channels](./channels) — Connect DingTalk / Feishu / QQ / Discord / iMessage to
     chat with CoPaw in those apps;
   - [Heartbeat](./heartbeat) — Set up scheduled check-in or digest (optional);
   - [CLI](./cli) — Init, cron jobs, clean working dir, etc.;
   - [Skills](./skills) — Understand and extend CoPaw’s capabilities;
   - [Config & working dir](./config) — Working directory and config file.
